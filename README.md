# Data Warehouse creation ETL Pipeline

This project aims to create an entire functional ETL Pipeline for building an entire system of a Data Warehouse to use it for Data Analysis purposes. In this case, beginning from constructing the workflow by desinging the Pipeline orchestrated with Airflow and Data Modeling the structure of the Database (By now using just MSSQLServer but it can be expanded to other DBMS).

By now there's not much abuout the new and fixed project, but the files of the original one are in the folder: Original Project Files, there are some others folders to contain the scripts of the querys for the database in the future and the diagram of the new expected Database.
